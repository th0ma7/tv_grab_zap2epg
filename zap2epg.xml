<!--
=== CONFIGURATION NOTES ===

1. FIRST TIME SETUP:
   - Update 'zipcode' with your US ZIP or Canadian postal code
   - Update 'tvhurl' with your TVheadend server IP if not localhost
   - Leave other settings as defaults for optimal performance

2. TVHEADEND INTEGRATION:
   - Recommended configuration for automatic channel filtering
   - Requires TVH user with proper permissions
   - Set tvhoff=false to disable and download all available channels

3. EXTENDED DETAILS:
   - xdesc=true provides enhanced descriptions with intelligent formatting
   - First run downloads series details (may take longer)
   - Subsequent runs reuse cached data (much faster)
   - Set both to false for basic mode (fastest)

4. PERFORMANCE TUNING:
   - Start with days=1 for testing, increase as needed
   - redays should match days for optimal cache management
   - Use debug mode for detailed statistics: --debug

5. MIGRATION FROM VERSION 2:
   - Script automatically removes deprecated settings:
     * useragent (no longer needed)
     * desc01-desc20 (replaced by intelligent formatting)
   - Configuration will be automatically upgraded to version 3
   - Backup will be created before any changes

6. EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS:

   Basic Mode (fastest):
   <setting id="xdetails">false</setting>
   <setting id="xdesc">false</setting>
   <setting id="days">1</setting>

   Full Featured (recommended):
   <setting id="xdetails">true</setting>
   <setting id="xdesc">true</setting>
   <setting id="days">7</setting>

   Without TVH Integration:
   <setting id="tvhoff">false</setting>
   <setting id="tvhmatch">false</setting>
   <setting id="slist">12345,67890,11111</setting>  <!-- Specify station IDs -->
